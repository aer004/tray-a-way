**Project Tray-a-way**

Our device is used as an item tracker targetted towards people living with roommates. 

**Inspiration**

Inspiration for this project came from reading many stories about roommates
using belongings without permission. A lot of suggestions involved the use of
a lockbox, but we wanted to avoid using such a provocative solution.
